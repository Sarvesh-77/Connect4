This is a reinforcement learning based project where we train models to play the game Connect4.

We initially tried training with traditional RL methods like SARSA, Q-Learning etc. but their performances were not good enough.

So we finally implemented more advanced models like DQNs, MCTS and AlphaZero which give good results.
